                higher learning was established in 1908 and is now a university system composed of eight constituent
                universities located in 17 campuses all over the archipelago.<br /><br /></p>
            <p>In 2012, the Commission on Higher Education declared 24 units of the university as Centers of Excellence;
                while 6 units have been declared as Centers of Development. For a more detailed list of the units and

                focus is on the strengthening of its information technology and business programs. In 2016, UP Cebu was
                declared a constituent university of the UP System.</p>
