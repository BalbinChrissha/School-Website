                        <p>As the premier State University, UP offers a wide range of degree programs. Some degree
                            programs are offered in only one campus (e.g., BS Nursing, BA Filipino) while others are
                            offered in two or more campuses (e.g., B Fine Arts, BS Statistics). Most of these require
                            qualification through the UP College Admission Test (UPCAT).</p><br />

                        <p>To maintain its high standard of education and to maximize its limited resources, UP has had
                            to limit slots for freshman admission to each campus and to its various degree programs.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            If you decide to take the UP College Admission Test (UPCAT), you will be one among many
                            thousands who aspire to enter the University of the Philippines.
                        </p><br />

                        <p>The UPCAT consists of 4 subtests: Language Proficiency, Science, Mathematics and Reading
                            Comprehension. Standardized scores on these subtests are combined with the weighted average
                            of final grades in the first three years of high school to determine qualification into UP.
                            Moreover, to implement the policy of democratization to make the UP studentry more
                            representative of the nationâ€™s population, socio-economic and geographic considerations are
                            factored in the selection of campus qualifiers.</p><br />
